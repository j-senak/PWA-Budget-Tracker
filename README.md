# PWA-Budget-Tracker
Here we are building a Progressive Web Application that tracks a user's budget. The user is able to add and subtract funds with titles attached to help keep track of their money. This application will also function offline.

## Why
Keeping track of your finances is hard but very important. With this app, I am hopefully making someone's life a little easier.
